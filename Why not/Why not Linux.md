Let -me tell you the truth about Linux and you. You tried enough to install Linux on your laptop by wasting your time, focus. It is time to stop. Listen to me! Why did you come back to Windows over and over again? Because you felt discomfort with Linux. The circumstances are not for you. You think "if I change my OS, it will be great and I will focus on working" and it is just false. Why? Let me tell you the downsides(dark sides) of using Linux on your laptop.
## 1. Stability
System is not as stable as you expected. Why? Desktops might crash often. You saw crashed and graphical issues. You might experience boot problems as well. Windows is much more stable and reliable while Linux can be overwhelming by just entering random commands. Have you ever seen a stable desktop in Linux? No, KDE is buggy, Gnome crashes a lot, Cinnamon also crashed. Other desktops? Huh, they are just outdated. Stay on Windows, you need to work hard!
### Solutions:
1. Use the latest software
2. Keep the system as minimal as possible to avoid crashes or conflicts
3. Use fixed-release distros (choose Fedora)
4. Always keep backups
## 2. Hardware
That is a big one. Wi-Fi signal does not work properly. You know, now, modern standby is not supported on Linux(on your laptop). You need to either enable IOMMU or change BIOS. First option may work but with doubts. You do not even know what it does. The second option? Hmmm, It used to work. Modern standby in Windows is way faster and lovely, is not it? Do not forget about Wi-Fi problem. It used to work poorly on Linux, but the situation changed thanks to a new kernel. Oh, another thing to mention: there is a bug with sound when you boot your computer and play a recorded video. It is unpleasant, is not it? When you use Windows, you will not feel any of these issues above.
### Solutions:
1. Do not use default icons of KDE if you use it, use Papirus-icon-theme (WIFI signal)
2. Enable IOMMU, or wait until the kernel release which may fix it
3. Idk about the sound problem
## 3. Desktop
Desktop Environments(DE) have always been a headache on Linux. They are either unstable, inconsistent or lack of new features. Most desktops do not support Wayland, that means we can only look at Gnome or KDE(Cosmic is not ready). Gnome looks good, solid, minimal. But it is not so stable and lacks features. Fractional Scaling is still bad. Apps are not open correctly in Gnome (with thick title bar + terrible scaling). KDE is buggy and ugly. Even you customize it, it remains ugly and inconsistent. Overall, although DEs offer customization and lightweight experience, they are not stable, there are no features I need(e.g. Touchpad gestures customization, windows-like scrolling, correct scaling, less GPU consumption). In contrast, Windows offers stable, smooth, solid interface.
### Solutions
1. Use KDE 
2. Use Gnome with 100% scaling
3. Get used to scrolling and touchpad limitations

## 4. Programs
Some programs are not available (e.g. Foxit pdf reader, SumatraPDF, Rufus, Bluebook) and some programs are not optimized or require more configuration. For instance, to use chromium-based browsers, I need to install VA-API codecs, HW acceleration packages and configure .desktop files manually. I need to force electron.js apps like VS code or Chrome to run on Wayland. Sometimes apps crash. Theming is inconsistent. You need to apply themes for both QT and GTK apps. Some apps are outdated so that they require XWayland to run properly. Even so, drag-and-drop does not work between Wayland and XOrg. Apps like WPS office are old and does not seem to work correctly. Anyways, I cannot use Linux due to my SAT preparation.
### Solutions
1. Use alternatives if available
## 5. A wide range of options
I hate having too many choices. If you want to install Linux, you need to choose a distro, which is an operation system that comes with GNU and Linux kernel. Let us say you have found the proper one, what next? Choosing a DE. Ahh, hold on. Maybe you can try a WM? It begs a question: which one? Too many options are here. You can choose: distro, bootloader, init system, packages, desktops, window managers, themes, icons, package managers, app formats(i.e. formats like Flatpak, Snap, Binary) and it goes on like that. Such a mess! When I install a distro as I expected, I cannot stand with it: because there are too many options to try, why not? Just fuck! In Windows, I have only one option and I have to get used to it. No problems. 
### Solutions:
1. Only Use Fedora with KDE, fuck any kind of other options
## 6. Misc.
### Real cases
Let me analyze which apps work well in Linux and which don't. 
#### Chrome (Brave too):
The overall experience is not that bad, however, video encoding software accelerated only. Also, it requires more manual config to just setup. Scrolling web is not as good as in windows.
##### Solutions: 
1. Use chrome as it is 
2. Use Firefox (which I do not like much)
3. Get used to scrolling
##### Visual Studio Code
It works great, however there are some problems with title bar and full screen, it is much usable though. 
##### Solutions:
1. Use custom title bar
2. You do not have to make it full screen
### PDF readers
Okular is the best alternative to SumatraPDF. But SumatraPDF is much more smaller and lightweight.

# The best solution
1. Stick with Windows 10 until it dies (literally, some apps will stop working properly)
	1. `With Kaspersky, you get better and longer security, if programs work properly, it is meaningless to switch`
2. You will get the latest fixes and updates in Linux world
	1. `Maybe, a lot of things will be fixed, new features added when you install it, this world is always progressing`
3. Get Fedora KDE workstation (I hope it will be available with the new Web installer)
	1. `KDE is the best option for now, maybe things will change. For example Cosmic and Cinnamon will be the other best options. Wayland is promising. I am interested in Fedora's new installer too. If KDE is workstation for Fedora, it will get better support`
4. Enjoy!
	1. `Linux is always to best option for programming. But for now, Windows 10 is pretty good and I am actually enjoying it, thanks to Kaspersky!`
