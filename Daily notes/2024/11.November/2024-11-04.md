Hello again! There reason why I could not restore myself is that I did not limit myself: I watched, played, ate and did a lot. This is why I am broken. I fapped in 2nd of November, 2024. I started using Reddit to make counter on my profile, read others posts about NoFap, and support them. I usually use NextDNS to filter my internet. So Everything is limited: I will have access to use Reddit and YouTube from 7 pm to 9 pm. Okay let's talk about today. How can I rescue myself quickly? I want to do my keystone habits today, also, I will take a bath. I need a lot of time to think about my future. But I might start with meeting with the IELTS books again. I will try my best! Today will be second day of NoFap!
