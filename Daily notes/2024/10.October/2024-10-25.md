# Notes
## Starting off
Hi there! I am here again! I need to tell you that something went wrong yesterday. Everything was and I was trying to work on myself. But, suddenly, I failed by watching erotic gifs and CP(in the dark web). So, I lost one day, however, I am not feeling I need to waste at least one week fapping and watching something again. Today I went for a run and did, meaning, I can easily get back to my track. An One-day lost doesn't mean I have became completely lazy or I have lost my performance on education. I will fix all of them today, after coming back home from my grandparent's next ceremony. 
## Why did I fail?
Is there a reason? Nope, It is just my mistake. I could survive without doing it. Yesterday I did not have an internet access, so I decided to go the room "The Risky Room"(I usually call it because I usually fail there). Then everything started: my old habits were suddenly awakened and they tempted a lot. I will try my best not to go that room again to avoid such mistakes.
## Troubleshoots
Now what is next? Being a shit again or removing it? Sure the latter. When I come back,
 - [ ] I will take a cold shower
 - [ ] I will meditate
 - [ ] I will listen to David Goggins(to gain motivation), 
 - [ ] I will listen to BBC 6 minute English, 
 - [ ] I will work out(to make hormonal balance)
 - [ ] I will start working
