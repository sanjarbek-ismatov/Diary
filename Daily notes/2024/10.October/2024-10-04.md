# Notes
I learned some interesting things to create in Obsidian. I am going to share them after eating something as I am hungry!
## Wandering
Okay I changed my mind. I am not going to provide guidance for now. Sometimes my mind tries to wander: without asking a permission. For example, today I unthinkingly looked at TV a few times and also wanted to remove the package manager of my phone. My mind tries to trick me, though it cannot. That is why mindfulness is necessary. If I let my mind do whatever it wants, today, it would probably ended up with fapping, watching movies, YouTube, playing games, eating the cakes in the fridge and so on. I can only manage it consciously, by only steering it. I do not reckon that I will fail if I restrict the my live. I try my best! By the way, I loved Obsidian, it is lightweight, efficient, minimal, offline, and functional, broadly speaking, as I wanted.   
## Description of my current life
After a few days of living without the internet: social media, YouTube, searching, educational apps, etc. I feel better now. Why? Although I do not have access to use educational apps, I am not feeling a need for them. I am mindful now. I realized that it is possible to live without music as well. How is my workout going? Great! I am going to tell what are changing in my performance, creativity, durability in details:
### Study
Oh, it the best thing I should mention. I am much more focused and tasks look joyful. Life Is colorful, even though my laptop's screen is grayscale. I can dedicate my time to work better, I can analyze information thoroughly, I can absorb myself in reading and I can immerse myself to write notes, essays. I am more creative on writing essays, my mind is clear and aware of the present. Focus? No problem at all. Finishing work encourages my to work again. Do not worry, I am keeping a balance, therefore, I am less likely to feel burnout.
### Workout
Without music, workout is just crazy. I do not have to pay attention to what kind of music I have, I am listening to and what music is next. I focus on what exercise I am doing without stimulating my dopamine level much. Anyway, sometimes my brain sings music, because it misses that.
### Emotional state
Controlling my emotions, being a positive or optimistic person, managing stress(though I am not sure) are not a big deal anymore(I am not mistaken). Despite the fact that I limit myself from the internet, I still think about sex, nudity and such thing, as usual. Because my mind needs a downtime to recover itself. As I am writing now, I am relaxing. But it used to be boring. Everything is changing, and will change if I keep it up.
