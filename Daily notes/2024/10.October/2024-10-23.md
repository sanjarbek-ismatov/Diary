# Notes
## Starting off
Hello there! I am here again and today is 23rd of October. I woke up at 5 am(4:10 am as well). Why? Because... My grandfather died yesterday. Yes. So Unfortunately, I will have to waste my a few days to attend the ceremonies. What would I do? Nothing. Okay. I am awake now! It was too dark and cold when I went out the home. I ran half the distance I usually run. Because I scared of dogs and dark(it was cold as well). I have little time to work. Ahh, I was making great progress while increasing willpower. No worries, I still try to manage everything! What can I do in this waiting time? I think I will work with "Review UNITs" in student's book. Bye for now! There is a lot to do.
