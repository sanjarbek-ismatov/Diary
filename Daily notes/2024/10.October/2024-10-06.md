## Starting off
I woke up at the same time. One thing I did: I got up with a quick reaction and as a result, my body produced cortisol as much as it can. Then I feel energized and I had a fresh mind. I walked as usual, run, and come back. Now I am typing on a keyboard to write some notes until breakfast gets ready. Today, I mostly review the UNIT 5 from student's book, practice the words I learned previously, and choose two books to order. That's it! Have a great day!
