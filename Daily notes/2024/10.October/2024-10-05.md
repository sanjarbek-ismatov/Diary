### Task 1
**The diagrams below show the design for a wind turbine and its location.**
*Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.*
![[Pasted image 20241005095503.png]]
#### Breakthrough

##### What do the diagrams show?
The structure of a wind turbine and optimum locations to place.
##### What should I write?
I should write an introduction what the diagrams show, body paragraphs in which I provide information of how it is structured and comparison between optimum locations, and overall.
##### Structure
1. Introduction: what the diagrams show
2. Body 1: the structure
3. Body 2: the locations
4. Overall: the key points

##### Report
The diagrams provide information on how a wind turbine is structured, optimum locations for its placement, as well as different types of wind turbines.

First, a wind turbine has a tall steel tower to hold the upper body of the turbine in the air. The upper section consists of blades made from either fiberglass or wood, a wind sensor behind the blades to analyze the speed and direction of wind, a generator that can produce 1.5 megawatts. Additionally, a computer in a building, near the wind turbine, is used to receive information from the sensor to adjust blades or to correct direction and angle based on wind data. 

Interestingly, there are two types of wind turbine. The first one is located upon a mountain where it can efficiently be used to capture maximum wind strength. Furthermore, the second type is a domestic version, usually small and is placed beside houses to serve as a power source for households, rather than providing a large-scale energy production, by generating 100 kilowatts.

Overall, while wind turbines are used to generate energy efficiently, to produce the maximum amount of energy, it should be located in areas where wind is strong to capture as wind's strength plays a crucial role here.

## Headache
Yes, headache. It suddenly occurred. I do not what is the reason for it. I assume that this is happening because I stripped drinking tea, a drink that includes caffeine. So I am having a headache. I have drunk a coffee, with an intention to fix my issue. If it happens tomorrow too, my assumption will be correct. For now, I am not fidgety, instead, tried. Wait... I am feeling energy again... Alright. I will start working soon. There is a lot to do. 

## The day's experience
Not bad. By the way, I wrote an article: [[Deep focus, multi-tasking]]. However, it needs to be checking, revised, see [[Deep focus, multi-tasking#Tasks]]. And I also started adding timelines at the bottom of article to observe changes. Tomorrow I will review the UNIT and complete these tasks:
