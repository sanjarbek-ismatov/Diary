Introduce the diagram, show how air leaks in and out, and make overall.
###### Draft
Air comes into house through dryer, kitchen vents, windows, electrical outlet, and crawl space. Air can goes out through chase attic hatch, recessed lights, bathroom fan vent, plumbing stack vent
###### Report
The diagram illustrates how air leaks in and out of a house, contributing to heat loss and energy wastage.

Overall, while air entering the house through various points contributes to some heat loss and electricity waste, air leaking out is a larger contributor than air leaking in, particularly in the upper areas of the house such as attics.

Air typically enters the house through several places, including electrical outlets, the crawl space, dryer vents, and kitchen vents. Interestingly, these are usually found in the bottom and middle areas of the house. Additionally, air also comes in through windows and doors.

On the other hand, heat is lost more especially by air escaping the house. Therefore, air leaks out primarily in the attic, through an attic hatch, recessed lights, bathroom vents, and plumbing stack vents. Also, heat loss occurs via chase.

# Notes
## Starting off
Hi there! I am here again. After losing a complete 12-day period, I am about working intensively. Today is 20th October. When I last worked hard, it was 7th October. Wow, an incredible amount of time for such a failure, right? This is why making that mistake leads to unexpected such behaviors.
What next? When is my next failure? Today? Tomorrow? Maybe one day in the week coming? No!!!!!!!!!!! My mission now, is to increase my willpower. How?
## I do what I do not want to do, I should do and vice versa
This is the only way to increase my willpower. If I do things later or when I am motivated, I am not going to increase my willpower, instead, keeping it in its level or even decreasing it. This is not what I want. When I face obstacles, urges, temptations, cues etc. I am not going to fail anymore. To do this, I need willpower.
### I did this before
Yes, when I was running my Telegram channel, I started doing this challenge after listening to the same podcast, in which Andrew Huberman and David Goggins had conversation together. Why did I fail in that moment and how did it go? I went great actually when I managed to work and push myself to do things even though I did not want to do. I could force myself and I was gaining willpower overtime. What happened? Telegram. Uncontrolled Telegram behaviors beat me. Eventually I failed. Now, I have way better chance to continue this approach. I do not have fucking social media or Telegram. I said no to them already.
