# Notes
## Starting off
Hi there, a loser is here! After losing 11 days, I am here again. I am not going to judge myself in this notes, instead, let me introduce the changes in my life. 
### Changes
#### Light mode
I am now using light mode. It looks fresh, professional and kind. I have completely switched to it:

#### Bringing back a browser
Yes, I also installed Chrome to work. You may ask: "but you have dictionary apps in your phone, why did you do that?". To reduce usage time of my phone. 
#### Perfectionism
After removing Store, Edge, WinGet, WSL, Curl, is my device broken? No, everything is working. I do not need them for now. I do not care! I have Chrome, VS Code, Anki, Obsidian, PowerShell, GCC etc.
