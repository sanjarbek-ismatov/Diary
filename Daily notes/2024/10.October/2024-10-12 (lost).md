I started the day in an average mood

# Notes
## Starting off
Hi there! Yesterday I promised myself to start "waking up" immediately rather than waiting for days. I got up at 6.30 am, I went for a walk, I ran for 2 rounds and came back. I am going to exposure myself to small but important part of the milestone - to be myself again! First, I will have breakfast, then wait longer for mindfulness. When it is warm, I will take a shower(a colder shower too), then I will talk with ChatGPT to discuss and review the previous topic. Next, I will try to read a book. Next steps are unknown yet though.

## New
Now I mark failed days with (lost) word to determine when and how many days I was dead.

## Failure
### One-week progress
First of all, one interesting thing is here: I worked effectively for a complete week without interruptions. Then I slept. 
### Why did I fail?
Hmm, first, I wanted to update Windows 23h2 to 24h2. Because it was released. I did not get it from update. So I wanted fresh installation. Before doing that, I also wanted to try ChromeOS Flex. COF worked well but not enough. I also revert my phone to MIUI. You may say what is a problem with that? I failed within that period. I wanted to try something new, I did not like it, then I continued with my old style. So the problem was in myself, I could be normal. Okay, I will not change my systems anymore. I am using Windows 10 and MIUI. Also, I do not search anything about Linux, Windows or custom ROMs.
