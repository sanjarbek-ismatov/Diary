# Notes
## Starting off
Hey there, Sanjarbek is here again! Do not you miss me? After losing complete 8 days, now I am going to fix everything. I am going to break the cycle: I made a mistake, I lose at least a week, I then try to get up by spending several days, then I get up. I made a mistake and wasted 8 days, but I do not want to spend days to wake up, instead, I will start working today! Look at them:
