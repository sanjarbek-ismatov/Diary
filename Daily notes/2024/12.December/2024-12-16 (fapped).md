# Notes
## Starting off
Hello everyone, I am here again. Day is the second day of restoring my mental health. Today is also 4th day of NoFap. I am going to share my feelings at the moment. So I am becoming a little more hornier than before. That is good news. But also a bit problematic too. I moved to the classic room, so my temptations are becoming slightly difficult to deal with. However, I think writing notes helps to activate pre-frontal cortex. I started reading "The Willpower Instinct" from 0 again to write down useful or important notes from it. I am also going to read my previous books as well to get their main points. Just reading books is not enough to gain something, you do it for joy of it, not to learn too much. For example, "Atomic Habits" helped a lot of people to change their lives while there is no result on my own. Instead of just reading them, I will also learn new words, will write what I understand to Obsidian. My comfort is here, so there is TV with YouTube, HDRezka, Lampa (the last two ones are good to watch adult content), I also have movie sites, two computers to play games and etc. Giving in them makes me exactly the same as other 99% of the world's population: losers. Every human being has willpower to resist the cheesecake (whatever).
