Hi there, I am here again. After one-week journey, I am happy to see the screen. My laptop is looking different to me, even I am typing so slowly as if I had no laptop before. Okay, let me check my laptop's health conditions first.

## The reason why I like Fedora KDE is that:

#### Wi-Fi:
- Wi-Fi work pretty fast and reliable in Linux, it does not alter my connected network to another or disappear adapter somewhat. It also has faster bandwidths speed.
#### CPU:
- My CPU frequency's range between 400 MHZ to 4096 MHZ in Linux with way better power management
- In Windows, if I use battery saver mode, the CPU run as if it is running on AC, after setting it to better battery mode and change it back to battery saver mode, it runs 1.5 GHZ minimally.
#### GPU:
 - KDE and Gnome use my dedicated GPU, while Windows somehow uses less of it. However battery saving is better on Linux.
#### Sleep:
 - Windows does not immediately suspend my laptop, it runs some background processes and then, if it wants, it switches to suspend mode.
 - In Linux, it is not a problem, it just goes to sleep and does nothing.
