Today, I tried to wake up. But I could not. Okay but it is not time to talk about it. I am going to promise myself not to fail again. I failed too many times. I promised myself not to make mistakes again and again. I just could not. I have only three month from this year and this looks like a tragedy. Can I fix all the problems I made within this period? Probably **yes** if I discipline. From tomorrow, *I will count days* remained from this year and record my day.
