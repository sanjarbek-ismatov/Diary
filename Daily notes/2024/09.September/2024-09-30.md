Hi again. I am feeling sick today too. Yes, But today I managed to get up quickly, run and read a book somehow. I need to struggle with the illness, but I can also work hard. Finally my brain has restored itself. 

After reading  pieces of **Deep work** I realized that deep work is crucial. So I do not want to use my phone or internet until I finish all the tasks I have to complete. The formula is so simple: work deeply, then review. I think learning new vocabulary or checking answers are not for my progress. What is my idea? Try to think deeply on answers for the tasks and guess with the best possibility.

I could not do [[2024-09-28#Tomorrow's goal is]]. That is okay, because my brain was rewiring its cells. No worries, I will try my best.
