Today is another day. But I could not start my day in a good mood. As usual, I could not wake up and stay awake after 6.30 AM. Today I had housework to do. I am a bit tired now. Neither did I read a book nor did something useful. For now, I cannot force myself to do something. Let me fix it by planning tomorrow. 
## Tomorrow's goal is:
1. [ ] Waking up and not sleeping again 
2. [ ] Complete morning routine 
3. [ ] Listening to the podcast
4. [ ] Reading at least 5 pages of the book
5. [ ] Exploring all apps from my phone
6. [ ] Exposure myself to Complete IELTS 
7. [ ] Starting SAT prep 
8. [ ] BBC 6 minute 
9. [ ] Workout for Chest & Back 
10. [ ] IELTS course 
11. [ ] Writing Notes 
12. [ ] Reading a book
## Things I must not do:
1. Entertainment (YouTube, Telegram, etc.)
2. Fapping (Adult content, porn, masturbation)
3. Sugar consumption
4. Playing games
5. Music
You might say, so time is 8:14 PM now, what will you do now except write? I think reading a book is a good option. I am going to continue reading **"Deep Work"**. #staymindful By the way, I should mention that I lost another day from this year today. So I have only 94 days left. If I subtract 4 from these days, I will have 90 days. I had 120 days ðŸ˜”, I lost it. No worries, If I stay consistent, I will achieve my dreams and goals. Writing here and using markdown is much funnier than Google Docs with traditional writing!
