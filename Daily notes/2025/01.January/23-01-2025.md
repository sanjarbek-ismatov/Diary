The reason why I block them is to avoid any kind of stimuli. Music can be a good source for motivation, energy. But hey, you know the rules. I am going quit them. Let me try to live without music to see if it is an essential part of my life. I guess not. 
# The course might be a game changer
I contacted to a teacher called Bahriddin near my home. Social isolation literally made me lonely, "sick". I need a community, people, even relationships (if appropriate). I can continue with nobody too, yet things will get more and more difficult. I am listening to Eminem's "Lose Yourself" track. I really missed this music.
