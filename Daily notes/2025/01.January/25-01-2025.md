# Starting off
Hi, I took a shower today and feel freshness. Now I am re-reading "The Willpower Instinct" again to get its ideas. But there are some words I should learn from it:
# Words
1. **Dictate** (*verb, noun*) - **1**. To control, telling exactly what must be done, obeyed; **2**. To influence
	1. *Others feel at the mercy of their thoughts, emotions,and cravings, their lives **dictated** by impulses rather than conscious choices.*
2. **Sabotage**(*verb, noun*) - **1**. To prevent a success or plan by damaging the ways to reach it (maybe intentionally)
	1. *I believe that much of what people believed about willpower was **sabotaging** their success.*
3. **Worn out** (adjective) - **1**. Used for long and can be no longer used as it is old; **2**. Extremely tired
	1. *Instead, people continued to rely on **worn-out** strategies for self-control.*
4. **Backfire** (*verb*) - **1**. To have the opposite results of what you intended (bad result).
	1. *I saw again and again that the strategies most people use were not just ineffective, they actually **backfired**, leading to self-sabotage and losing control*.
5. **Delight** (*noun, verb*) - **1**. Feeling of pleasure, happiness; **2**. To give someone pleasure, happiness.
	1. *To my delight, the course quickly became one of the most popular course ever offered  by Stanford Continuing Studies*.
They are enough for today. I am going to read the book thoroughly to catch important notes, implement them into my life. Otherwise, the books I read are just paper that include letter, yet nothing usefull.
