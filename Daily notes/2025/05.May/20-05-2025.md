# The fucked up mindset
After a long period of trials to quit porn, I still couldn't manage to deal with it. I fail again and again with a conscious mind. My streak was 5 days and succeeding. But after slipping off, things started to change. Now, I am feeling weakness and willing to change things. Instead of just counting days, I am also going to count hours to celebrate small achievements. I have set a picture of David Goggins on my desktop, browsers, Telegram background with the hope of getting reminded of my weakness every time. I am going to increase the numbers of the days of the 30-day challenge as I relapsed. But, I will keep the record of my previous streak to understand what happened to me. From now, every hour counts.
