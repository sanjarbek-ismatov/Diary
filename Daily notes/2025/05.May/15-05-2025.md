# First time for Obsidian being used in the class room.
Unfortunately, it was a good idea. Because I had to wait long to enter the room, which made the use of my laptop impossible. But, I guess writing notes using Obsidian is much more fun than using my notebook, as I do not have to deal with some sorts of problems such as my writing style. Also, switching to the light mode enabled me to enjoy the colors and see the world more clearly. It is boiling hot, but who cares? I am almost ready for the class, even though I did not take much time and effort to accomplish tasks. However, I did shallow work, so it is not going to be sustainable knowledge for long run.
# Plans after leaving the class room
When I come back home, first of all, I am going to "pray", then I will go out to work out. There will be a great chance to read some book and do mindfulness. I guess my cousin has bought "Shaurma" for me, but I am still indecisive to eat that. 

# Practice for C++ multidimensional arrays
I am going to create the ship battle game and array renderer (which beautifully prints arrays with their curly braces, commas).
## Some theories
Multidimensional arrays have rows and columns. For example: ```
```arr\[2\]\[2\]\[2\]```
```cpp
{
	{
		{} {}
	}{
		{} {}
	}
}
{
	{
		{} {}
	}{
		{} {}
	}
}
```
It is difficult to imagine the visual look of a multidimensional array, yet with a bit work, it can be achievable.
