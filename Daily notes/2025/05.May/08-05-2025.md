# Absence
After being absent for a long time, I am here again to write things down. Of course, I missed a lot, for example April. There is no even folder for April, which is my fault. Now, I am going to be active to restore my old habits, as I forgotten many of them.
# Habits to restore
There are plenty of habits which were useful when I was with them, then I started becoming lazy and distracted. Before get started, I need to mention that I am going to remove some distractions such as YouTube or other entertainment.
