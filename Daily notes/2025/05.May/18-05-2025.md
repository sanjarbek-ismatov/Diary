# Solved problem
After tweaking the system a little bit, now I have a fully working system. But one surprising thing happened: since Windows 11 24h2, the Wi-Fi did not used to work well with the official drivers from Microsoft updates and HP. So I had to use the built-in basic driver. I worked well, but did not meant to be used for production. Yesterday I tried to install a bit newer driver from an unofficial website, surprisingly, it worked well. In fact, HP officially released this driver (November update), but did not offer it to me. So I had to install it manually. Now it is performing seamlessly. But shame on Microsoft and HP for not caring about my system. My laptop is certified and has OEM license for Windows 10 and 11 home. I also enable require and optional diagnostics to enable Microsoft to address this issue. I also a few times reported this problem using Feedback Hub. But nothing was changed. Now, I know how to fix the issue, I am finally satisfied. I wish I had fixed it much earlier to prevent OS switching a lot.
# Windows is my home now
After having a fully stable system, I am using Windows 11 primarily with a couple of reasons. I am going to clarify all the issues with Linux and my experience with Windows.

### Stepwells

A **millennium** ago, stepwells were **fundamental to life** in the driest parts of India. Richard Cox travelled to north-western India to document these spectacular monuments from a **bygone** era

During the sixth and seventh centuries, the **inhabitants** of the modern-day **states** of Gujarat and Rajasthan in north-western India developed a method of gaining access to clean, fresh **groundwater** during the dry season for drinking, bathing, watering animals and Irrigation. However, the significance of this invention - the stepwell - goes beyond its utilitarian application.

**Unique to this region**, stepwells are often architecturally complex and vary widely in size and shape. During their heyday, they were places of gathering, of leisure and relaxation and of worship for villagers of all but the lowest classes. Most stepwells are found dotted round the desert areas of Gujarat (where they are called var) and Rajasthan (where they are called baori), while a few also survive in Delhi. Some were located in or near villages as public spaces for the community; others were positioned beside roads as resting places for travellers.

As their name suggests, stepwells comprise a series of stone steps descending from ground level to the water source (normally an underground **aquifer**) as it **recedes** **following the rains**. When the water level was high, the user needed only to descend a few steps to reach it; when it was low, several levels would have to be **negotiated**.

Some wells are vast, open **craters** with hundreds of steps paving each sloping side, often in tiers. Others are more elaborate, with long stepped passages leading to the water via several **storeys**. Built from stone and supported by pillars, they also included **pavilions** that **sheltered** visitors from the **relentless** heat. But perhaps the most impressive features are the **intricate** decorative sculptures that embellish many stepwells, showing activities from fighting and dancing to everyday acts such as women **combing** their hair or **churning** butter.

**Down the centuries**, thousands of wells were constructed throughout north-western India, but the majority have now fallen into **disuse**; many are **derelict** and dry, as groundwater has been **diverted** for industrial use and the wells no longer reach the water table.
