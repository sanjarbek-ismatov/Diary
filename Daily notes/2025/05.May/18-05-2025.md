# Solved problem
After tweaking the system a little bit, now I have a fully working system. But one surprising thing happened: since Windows 11 24h2, the Wi-Fi did not used to work well with the official drivers from Microsoft updates and HP. So I had to use the built-in basic driver. I worked well, but did not meant to be used for production. Yesterday I tried to install a bit newer driver from an unofficial website, surprisingly, it worked well. In fact, HP officially released this driver (November update), but did not offer it to me. So I had to install it manually. Now it is performing seamlessly. But shame on Microsoft and HP for not caring about my system. My laptop is certified and has OEM license for Windows 10 and 11 home. I also enable require and optional diagnostics to enable Microsoft to address this issue. I also a few times reported this problem using Feedback Hub. But nothing was changed. Now, I know how to fix the issue, I am finally satisfied. I wish I had fixed it much earlier to prevent OS switching a lot.
# Windows is my home now
After having a fully stable system, I am using Windows 11 primarily with a couple of reasons. I am going to clarify all the issues with Linux and my experience with Windows.
