# Greeting
After wasting a week or more than it, now I am here to rock again. It's 5:47 AM now, and I woke up at about 5 AM. Today is the first day of spring: 1st of March. That means I wasted another month with little progress. Wasting time is my job? Let me change this stereotype about me, do not pigeonhole yet. I planned this month: [[00.Goals for March]]

# Plan for today
Okay, after making goals for this month, I am going to plan my day:
- [ ] #Emergency Working with the words from the homework **right after planning**
- [ ] #Emergency Preparing for Speaking (Housework and Internet)
- [ ] #Emergency Collecting words from the sheets and learn
- [ ] C programming (Geeksforgeeks)
- [ ] Working out for upper body at home (mostly for arms)
- [ ] #Emergency Working with the homework which will be given
- [ ] Reading a book
# By the way, if you get bored: [[Coping with boredom]]
