# Greeting
Hi there, although I am writing notes so late, I am going to describe my day. Okay, first, I made the same mistake: not listening to my problem. I did not get enough sleep as my mother broke my sleep cycle again. But today, I am going to be strictful. I completed my homework with some doubts. 
# The seemingly overwhelmed brain
My brain is now trying to cheat me by offering anxiety, stress and fear of whether I relapsed or not. I was exposed to some part of nudity accidentally. My brain is trying to sexualizing everything, yet still cannot achieve its goal of defeating me. I accept all of them as lies and never think about relapses. I did not fail, I did not intentionally look at some nudity, my brain almost couldn't realize what I saw. 
# The strategy defeat the trick
I think it is a good idea to find or develop some strategies to overcome my addiction. Otherwise it could kill my commitment. But how? First of all, I will keep not looking at girls, even I do instinctively, I do not repeat it. I will continue meditation, cold showers, running, exercising as forms of dealing with the tricks. There is no need to worry, I have not relapsed and will not relapse if I stay consistent, otherwise, the same trap will kill me. 
# To my future self
I am going to say hello to my future: Sanjar in the evening. I am the same as you, I will make you proud of me, you will thank me for sticking to commitment. I will fight against everything, I do not accept a defeat before the war.
