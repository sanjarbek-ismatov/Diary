# Greeting
Hi there, after being absent for 2 days. Now I am alive again. Today I am going to plan the day realistically. Tomorrow was not painful, so I am going to feel the full pain. Let's see what will happen. Today my legs, brain, and body will scream. They will say: please stop motherfucker, you need to get warm, rested. Who cares? I will show my beast today.
# Plan
- [ ] #Emergency I will finish home tasks completely:
	- [ ] #Emergency I will complete full reading, mark all the words, learn them, write them down to my notebook
	- [ ] #Emergency I will learn the new collocations, the words from speaking
- [ ] I will start C programming, reach until pointers
- [ ] I will run for 25 rounds, so I will take 2 hours (at 4 PM)
- [ ] I will finish UNIT 7 on Complete IELTS
- [ ] I will read a book for 50 minutes starting at 9 PM
# Fake productivity
Okay, I need to tell you one truth. The truth is when I plan the day without taking action feels it makes me productive but actually not. I will just get a dopamine hit. So After this day, I will first start the day, take a breakfast, plan the other part of the day. The reason why I am going to change my lifestyle is that I am caring more about numbers and checkbox, not about working productively.
