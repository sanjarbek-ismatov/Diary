### How to organize them
First of all, I need to mention that I am currently not taking time for: self IELTS preparation (never), C programming (barely), General English (never), Writing notes (barely).
### My day parts
I usually start working on the homework after I come home from running. I roughly begin completing the tasks at 6:30 AM. I think I should stop doing them after 12 PM. So I take a break for 1 hour (napping + cold shower). I need to cram SAT and Programming into that part of day: from 1-1:30 PM to 6 PM. But I am starting the session too late, so I will be careful from tomorrow. around 6 hours is a good amount of time to work on both. Then I go for working out until 7 PM. I will have 2 hours to work with my books (IELTS), then start reading a book after 9 PM.
