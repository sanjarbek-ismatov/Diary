# Greetings (again)
In fact, I was there. I wrote some notes, but due to conflicts with Logseq, I decided to reset my git main branch. I removed the last two notes together. Okay, I was telling about restoring myself systematically. Today, I managed to wake up at 6 AM eventually (actually 6:50, I was awake, but did not get up). Then I started running as I used to do. I am experiencing extreme laziness. 
# Using Logseq for a different purpose
Obsidian is just great for professional note taking. I yesterday tried Logseq, and love it. But it is not what I want. So instead of merging Logseq and Obsidian notes, I think I will split them for good. I will use Logseq for my Telegram channel to write posts before publishing and I will use Obsidian as I am using now. I think this is a good idea.
# Plan for today
Okay, do not get me wrong, but I am too much lazy today. So my willpower challenges may sound ridiculous. But this is important.
