# Greeting
After an one-day skipping, I am here again. Today I woke up at 5.30 AM and did everything as intended. Today is going to be an exciting day as my course is going to be opened. Okay, let me recap tomorrow: I guess, things were not bad, I even made progress towards IELTS. However, I did not even open Obsidian to write things down. But I am going to plan today
## Plan
1. [x] I meditate after finishing this plan
2. [x] I will start working on IELTS (until the breakfast), right after meditation
