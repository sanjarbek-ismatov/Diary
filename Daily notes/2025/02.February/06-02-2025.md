# Limiting
It's been a long time. I have to limit myself, otherwise I will die. I am going install Fedora KDE desktop with a little bit tweaks. I have it on my USB Flash Drive. Why KDE? It is just as usable as fuck. Why not Gnome? There more limitations with Gnome. Cinnamon? Good idea. There reason why I limit myself with Linux is to avoid bad encounters for now. Why Cinnamon? It is usable, stable and great, also supports touchpad gestures well. It is a great variant. No BTRFS, no fancy stuff. I will not customize it. I am gonna stay alive. I will remove my privilage from sudoers.
# Why not staying with Windows
Sure, I will keep Windows. But, come on, when I am free, I will discover bad things. The only effective way is to my workstation. I do not need any fancy customizations. Why not KDE or Gnome? They are not flexible to me. I will use Firefox for sure. No doubts about that. I do not need fucking updates too much.
# Cinnamon
I will use Cinnamon, but: not flatpak, snap, selinux, firewalld, third-party themes, packages (except official ones), some system core tools, removing plymouth. I will use some necessary apps:
# English
- Browser: Firefox, Edge
