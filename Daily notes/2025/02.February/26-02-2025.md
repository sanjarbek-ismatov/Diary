# Greeting
Today, is another day of attending a course. I do not think I am well-prepared for this, but, hey, I will try my best to answer questions as much as possible. There are words to memorize, a passage to complete and questions for speaking. I am not sure if I can complete all of them, yet trying only helps to analyze. 
# Detoxing again
I sucked my life again, so I need to revive it and clear every shits from it. I took a cold shower and meditate although I failed to resist watching an "explicit" content which I will not do anymore. After coming home, I am going to consider the homework an emergency. I do not want to deal with sh\*ts again. 
# What will I do next?
Well, it is obvious.
