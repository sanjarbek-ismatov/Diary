# Greeting
Hi, I am here again. Today is the second day of fighting against my impulsive-self. The fight is not going to be for a short period of time, as he has become much more stronger than before. Fortunately, it is hard to fail here, because there is no option to watch porn: no TV, computers, laptops, phones are accessible. I am going to fight against it. It feels tough and waste of time until my brain wakes up. Let me try to build a strategy for today. I am going to spend much of my time for watching a podcast, reading a book, meditation, breath control, reading articles and some English training. By the way, I can't feel mental clarity now. Today I will fix it.
