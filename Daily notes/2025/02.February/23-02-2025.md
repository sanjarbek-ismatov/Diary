# Greeting
Hi, as usual. I would like to say something good about yesterday, but unfortunately. Ohh, do not get me wrong, I did not give in temptation. Just, I did not make much progress that day. But things will change, I do not need too much motivation to start working. Let me start with pain. As I do not start easily my running sessions, I am not going to ease my studying too. So, it is not going to be introduction.
# Plan
