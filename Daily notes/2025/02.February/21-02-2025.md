# Greeting
Hi there, I am here again after getting up and running. My right leg hurts. I do not know how to fix it, but I will try to find ways to deal with it. First, I will use a cream to ease the pain, then I will buy medical "binds" (I do not know the word in English, but I will find it and fix it), and wrap my legs strongly to prevent more problems. You may think, bro, you need to heal it first, but I say: I know, but this should prevent me from working. If it really sucks and makes me even bad, I will try to repair it.
# Reviewing yesterday
Yesterday was not bad. I did my best to complete (okay, let's be honest, I tried, not my best) the tasks. However, I couldn't complete some of them. Today I will try to make less excuses.
