The first thing mentioned in the book is to detect how and why you fail. It is the main point, if you do not know these reasons, you are probably going to fail again. Okay, let us review my failures with porn addiction. Usually I fail because either I lose my track or am in comfort zone. I already detected my previous mistakes: using social media, YouTube tempts to fap. Also, whenever I do something with OS (changing, repairing, updating, setting up) I will have a ritual to fap and start a "fresh" life, which is always a lie. I removed them, now, there are some remaining backdoors. First one is my comfort zone. Whenever I enter and am alone in my father's room, my brain begins to seek dopamine. Solutions? I should move to my grandmother's room, and the problem is solved. But this is not the case for some situations. So, instead, I am going to deal with this room.
