# I finished reading this book
I have read many books related to productivity, willpower, psychology and other important topics that may help me to analyze myself (in fact, I will have read many books). I finished this book after a couple of months. Actually, it was 2024 when I first started reading it. Then, I got in trouble many time by overreacting to my addictions, as a result, I needed to read this book three time until I reach the page where I left. Finally, I managed to complete reading, but missed one important point: I haven't written any conclusions, reviews or real-life examples. So I decided to look back and think again about this book. I am going to cover each chapter by reviewing them, concluding, real-life situations, if it helped me, if so how, would I recommend, if needed, I will adjust the experiments to myself.
