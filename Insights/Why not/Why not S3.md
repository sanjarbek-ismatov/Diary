I used to use S3 sleep state until the BIOS update broke it. It was amazing, battery consumption was very little. After updating BIOS, S3 did not seem to work properly. Anyway, I accustomed to the new Modern standby(S0 sleep state). In fact, I used it for a while until I understood how to change it. Then Linux worked as well(it does not support modern standby in my laptop). Nowadays, I cannot use S3 sleep state due to wrong firmware updates. Should I really use it?
## Why should I use it?

- It saves battery a lot
- It has more customization(I can even create three types of profiles by default)
- It supports Linux seamlessly
- It is well supported
## Why should I switch back again?

- My current firmware does not support it correctly:
	1. My laptop does not wake up after opening the lid
	2. Touchpad cannot even make my laptop awake
- It requires third-party tools to bring back
- I need to reinstall the system to use it
	1. This kills my focus, wastes my time
	2. My SSD will tend to be dead more quickly
	3. I need to setup from scratch again
- Modern standby is great for me
## Why Modern standby over S3?

I used Modern standby a lot in the past. I do not complain about it. It is fast, well-supported, optimized for Windows. I can easily open my workspace was faster than I did in S3 sleep state. Linux does not work properly if I install, that means I do not have to change my system, which is great! I also like adaptive hibernation mode. S0 does not drain my battery faster. The difference is little. I do not care about power profiles. Because the laptop can last enough. So, switching to S3 is useless, especially now I cannot resume my laptop from sleep. Who knows? Perhaps, it consumes much battery. Moreover, when I update my BIOS, it automatically sets S0 as default sleep state. So it is officially supported and recommended, why not use?
