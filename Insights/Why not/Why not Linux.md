Let me tell you the truth about Linux and you. You tried enough to install Linux on your laptop by wasting your time, focus. It is time to stop. Listen to me! Why did you come back to Windows over and over again? Because you felt discomfort with Linux. The circumstances are not for you. You think "if I change my OS, it will be great and I will focus on working" and it is just false. Why? Let me tell you the downsides(dark sides) of using Linux on your laptop.
## 1. Stability
System is not as stable as you expected. Why? Desktops might crash often. You saw crashed and graphical issues. You might experience boot problems as well. Windows is much more stable and reliable while Linux can be overwhelming by just entering random commands. Have you ever seen a stable desktop in Linux? No, KDE is buggy, Gnome crashes a lot, Cinammon also crashed. Other desktops? Huh, they are just outdated. Stay on Windows, you need to work hard!
## 2. Hardware
That is a big one. Wi-Fi signal does not work properly. You know, now, modern standby is not supported on Linux(on your laptop). You need to either enable iommu or change BIOS. First option may work but with doubts. You do not even know what it does. The second option? Hmmm, It used to work. Modern standby in Windows is way faster and lovely, is not it? Do not forget about wifi problem. It used to work poorly on Linux, but the situation changed thanks to a new kernel. Oohh, another thing to mention: there is a bug with sound when you boot your computer and play a recorded video. It is unpleasent, is not it? When you use Windows, you will not feel any of these issues above.

## 3. Desktop
Desktop Environments(DE) have always been a headache on Linux. They are either unstable, inconsistent or lack of new features. Most desktops do not support Wayland, that means we can only look at Gnome or KDE(Cosmic is not ready). Gnome looks good, solid, minimal. But it is not so stable and lacks features. Fractional Scaling is stil bad. Apps are not open correctly in Gnome (with thick titlebar + terrible scaling). KDE is buggy and ugly. Even you customize it, it remains ugly and inconsistent. Overall, although DEs offer customization and lightweight experience, they are not stable, there are no features I need(e.g. Touchpad gestures customization, windows-like scrolling, correct scaling, less GPU consumption). In contrast, Windows offers stable, smooth, solid interface.

## 4. Programs
Some programs are not available (e.g. Foxit pdf reader, SumatraPDF, Rufus, Bluebook) and some programs are not optimized or require more configuration. For instance, to use chromium-based browsers, I need to install Vaapi codecs, HW acceleration packages and configure .desktop files manually. I need to force electron.js apps like VS code or Chrome to run on Wayland. Sometimes apps crash. Theming is inconsistent. You need to apply themes for both QT and GTK apps. Some apps are outdated so that they require xwayland to run properly. Even so, drag-and-drop does not work between Wayland and Xorg. Apps like WPS office are old and does not seem to work correctly. Anyways, I cannot use Linux due to my SAT preparation.

## 5. A wide range of options
I hate having too many choices. If you want to install Linux, you need to choose a distro, which is an operation system that comes with GNU and Linux kernel. Let us say you have found the proper one, what next? Choosing a DE. Ooo, hold on. Maybe you can try a WM? It begs a question: which one? Too many options are here. You can choose: distro, bootloader, init system, packages, desktops, window managers, themes, icons, package managers, app formats(i.e formats like Flatpak, Snap, Binary) and it goes on like that. Such a mess! When I install a distro as I expected, I cannot stand with it: because there are too many options to try, why not? Just f*ck! In Windows, I have only one option and I have to get used to it. No problems.
