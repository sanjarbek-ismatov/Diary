Well, It a bit complex topic. I will share my insight over time, as I feel urged to porn.
# Read if you do not know why you should resist it
## Overview
Okay, It happened all time. As you know, when you feel urges or temptation to watch porn, just stop and think: is it really needed to you? Your mind is only thinking about releasing high amount of dopamine, it does not care about yourself, your emotional state, or you future. You felt temptation too many times. Sometimes you refused, sometimes not. Did you benefit when you accept? Nope. You have always felt depressed, guilty, stressed after doing the process. You think about naked women, or they are having sex with men; orgasm or ejaculation, enjoyment, right? When you finished your job, when did you feel motivated, happy? Never. You always regretted. Think about yourself, when are you going to leave it? Now or never. 
## Benefits I got
Oh, this is much better than fapping. For example, today I felt tempted, but I did not fail, as a result, I felt so motivated that even now I am feeling it. It is such an amazing feeling. I have gotten this feeling many times when I did not fail after a long period of temptation. It always happens, just wait a magic to see. I promise you, but if you fail, I guarantee a feeling of loser.
